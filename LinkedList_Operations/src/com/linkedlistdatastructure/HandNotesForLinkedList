 Data-Structures:
•	As wkt, linkedlist do not require continous memory.
*   This is the advantage of linkedlist.
•	Unlike array which stores data in one cell, linkedlist
    along with data it stores the addrss of next node.
•	starting part of the linkedlist is HEAD of the linkedlist.
•	HEAD usually stores the first element and address of next elem.
•	and similary last node stores only data and points to null.
•	This makes list flexible length in its size.

   Where it is used:
   
•	Stack and Queue implementation.
•	In browser we use, i.e in the browser we keep open many tabs,
    there will be two arrows forward and backward.
•	Each node will have data and address to next node 
•	So we cannot store both data and address in any of the datatypes that java provides.
•	So this y we have to define self defined datatype.

How do we convert An array into Linked list in java?

•	Head will store the first element of the array. Let’s assume the next ptr
     is pointing to nothing for time being.                                           
•	Now for x we can assign the temp , move the mover to next node and move the
    temp to the next node.
